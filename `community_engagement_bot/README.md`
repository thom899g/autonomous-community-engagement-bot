# Autonomous Community Engagement Bot

This repository contains the implementation of an AI-driven outreach tool designed to interact with users across various platforms like forums and social media. It uses NLP for communication and sentiment analysis to gather feedback, evolving through user engagement to better serve the community.

## Architecture Overview

The system is composed of several key components:

1. **CoreBot**: The main module that handles bot initialization, configuration, and core functionality.
2. **Adapters**: Platform-specific adapters (e.g., for Twitter, Reddit) that handle communication with different platforms.
3. **NLP Module**: Handles text generation and understanding using state-of-the-art NLP models.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes user sentiment to tailor responses appropriately.
5. **Feedback Loop**: Continuously improves the bot's performance based on user interactions.
